## A Harvard-structure CPU which supports 31 Mips instructions

## Brief Intro

This is a super-tiny toy CPU with ```Harvard-structure``` which can support 31 ```Mips``` instructions. All instructions are executed within one period thus ```pipeline technique``` is **not** utilized. It is also submitted as a mid-term project for *Tongji University* *CS 101016* course. 



## Platforms and devices

+ ```Visual Studio Code``` with ```iverilog``` and ```gtkwave```
+ ```vivado 2016.2```
+ DIGILENT Nexys4 DDRâ„¢ FPGA Board

+ additional notes
  - ```slt```: we directly compute the result in ```ALU```.
  - ```sllv``` : though the value we get from ```Rs``` is already 32 bit , we want to restrain it to 0-31, so we pass the lowest 5 bits to ```Ext5-16```.
  - ```lui``` : we do not use ```Rs``` register here, just for the consistency with other instructions.
  - ```Ext16_32``` : this component can perform both zero-extend and signed-extend.
  - ```jal``` : the address restored in ```$31``` depends on the specific standard of ```Mips``` .

## Milestones

- 2023-5-7 21:20  :  **Functional simulation** passes.
- 2023-5-9 16:20  :  **post-synthesis simulation** passes.
- 2023-5-9 16:23  :  generate bit stream to **FPGA board** successfully. 



## How to change a ```vivado``` project into lovely ```VScode```

+ substitute ```IP core``` with our hand-written ```imem_module.v```

+ delete the head lines starting with ```include``` for ```vivado``` will build hierarchy automatically. 

+ mend ```cputb.v``` ,delete following lines:

  ```verilog
  initial
  begin
      $dumpfile("cpu.vcd");
      $dumpvars;
      #2000;
      $finish;
  end
  
  ```
